FOR TEST COLUMN:
We have 1.Attempted TEST
        2. Live TEST
        3.Assigned TEST

AIM:
The user should be able to attend a TEST.

PROCEDURE:
1.Give user a page where he can select what test to attempt for which the source is database
2.After selecting, give him the instructions page
3.Then take him to the test page
4.The test is acutually fetched from database
5.We can use local storage to store the data untill the test is completed and then when completed, we can send the RESULT to the database
6. As soon as the test is completed, we fetch the data from local storage and perform the calculations and then we send back the result to the database.
7. So basically, we should have a collection to store all the questions which is public
  and when we want to fetch data, 
  it is available for every user(of course we can add some restrictions for specified users)
8. Each and every user has a database space for storing the resutls of the tests he attempted.

TEST PAGE:
1. It should consist of a Timer.
2. It should have a question pallate so that the user can navigate through the questions
3. It should have 
     *SUBMIT BUTTON(which may have some conditions)
     *NEXT BUTTON(navigates user to the next question)
     *PREVIOUS BUTTON (navigates user to the previous question))
     *ABORT BUTTON(Aborts the test and does not save any data---> requires confirmation)

4. It should have the test area where user is able to see the questions and select the options.
