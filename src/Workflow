WORKFLOW FOR TODOLIST:

* First of all, for each and every unique user, we have to have a unique document,
i.e whenever a new user is created, create a collection with his uid as name
* And then , whenever the user adds a todo, it is first sent to the database and gets added there.
* so this way , all the todos will be added to the database
* now for the display part, we will loop through all the datas in the database and then render it in the child
